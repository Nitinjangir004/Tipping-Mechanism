# Tipping Mechanism Smart Contract

## Overview
The **Tipping Mechanism** is a decentralized smart contract deployed on the **Edu Chain** that allows users to send peer-to-peer tips securely and transparently. This system ensures that anyone can reward others for their contributions or achievements using blockchain technology.

## Deployed Contract
- **Contract Address:** `0x5ae91289d3a7f9a3de0d4dd6cf06301295b0eaa7`
- **Blockchain Network:** Edu Chain

## Features
âœ… **Peer-to-Peer Tipping:** Users can tip others with cryptocurrency directly on-chain.
âœ… **No Middleman:** Funds are transferred instantly without any intermediary.
âœ… **Secure & Transparent:** Transactions are recorded on the blockchain for public verification.
âœ… **Permissionless:** Anyone with an Ethereum-compatible wallet can send and receive tips.
âœ… **No Deployment Input Needed:** The contract works without requiring parameters at deployment.

## How It Works
1. **Send a Tip:** Users call the contract function to tip another user by sending ETH.
2. **Funds Go Directly:** The recipient receives the tip instantly on-chain.
3. **No Setup Required:** Users do not need to register or set up accounts.
4. **Transaction Transparency:** All tipping transactions are recorded on the blockchain.

## Smart Contract Functions
- `tip(address recipient)`: Sends a tip to the specified recipient.
- `getBalance(address user)`: Retrieves the balance of a specific user.
- `withdraw()`: Allows users to withdraw their received tips.

## How to Use
1. Connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Edu Chain.
2. Call the `tip()` function and specify the recipientâ€™s address along with the tip amount.
3. The recipient can view their balance and withdraw funds when needed.
